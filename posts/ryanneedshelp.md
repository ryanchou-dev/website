anyways so ive been listening to a lot of music while im studying and now i think spotify is very confused about my music taste.

you see, spotify has a niftly little feature called autoplay, and it's (supposed to) play similar songs. but i think spotify hates me because it'll go play whichever song it wants.

[*how in the world do you go from lofi to pop ðŸ˜­*]

while i may never know why spotify recommends these songs, i can confirm that it can throw me down two hours of listening to christmas music and dying inside. WHY IS ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU STUCK IN MY HEAD ITS NOT EVEN THAT GOOD OF A SONG

i swear i must not have a life to how badly i want christmas to happen ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­

aaand, that is all. tyty for reading, ~ciao ðŸ¦†~
