# Los Altos Hacks VII

Hey! Here is a vivid recollection of my experience at [Los Altos Hacks VII](https://losaltoshacks.com), an in-person ~24-hour~ 27-hour hackathon at Juniper Aspiration Dome. I teamed up with Maggie ([@maggie-j-liu](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu)) and we built: [Magicard](https://github.com/maggie-j-liu/magicard)! A website that allows you to attach videos to physical cards that people can view using AR!

Although it was super crowded, it was still really fun :3

### ~10:00 AM

The venue felt a lot different from when we went ~2 weeks prior because of all the people. It used to feel hollow and empty, but now, it feels... alive?

When we got inside the venue, it was already super crowded. It was a bit hard to find a place to sit, but we eventually found a spot. Afterward, we went to go check out the sponsor tables! There were a bunch, and it was super fun to pick up all the free swag LOL.

### ~11:00 AM

So, their opening ceremony took like an hour because of all of their sponsors (they had so many 😩), but it gave us a chance to brainstorm more and check out all the tracks. We were especially excited by all of the food that they were gonna give us. (plus a "midnight surprise" -- although we were able to guess it by the sponsors 😍🧋)

### ~12:00 PM - 2:30 PM

We were pretty excited about using Niantic's 8th Wall to develop an AR app, so we spent some time brainstorming ideas and looking at the documentation/example projects. We also ate lunch, which was an enormous slice of pizza, no idea why they ordered that much LMAO.

### ~2:30 PM - 3:15 PM

We attended the first workshop, which was about using 8th Wall to make a web AR app. It was pretty interesting, and the speaker was very enthusiastic :D

After this, we decided on making Magicard, with

- Niantic's 8th Wall
- React & Next.JS
- Cloudinary

and began hacking :>

### ~4:00 PM

✨ [RUIEN](https://rluo.dev) APPEARANCE ✨

Sliding over the fact I almost asked a random kid if he was Ruien because I didn't know what he looked like, it was super fun to meet him irl for the first time, and he was super nice :D

He also got an amazing custom ID card, which you should totally scan if you can ;D

### 4:00 PM - 12:00 AM

Hacking! We did a lot of work on the website and got most of the content out. We got AR working in the browser, and we were able to scan image targets and view the videos. After this, we set up the video recording, and I worked on the design, while Maggie set up video uploading and connecting it to the 8th Wall project.

Other than that, we ate dinner, did cup stacking, participated in a CTF round, and drank a lot of boba 🧋.

Plus, the sponsors for bill.com had left for the night, and we took over their sponsor table!! We were able to do some [Sprig](https://sprig.hackclub.com/) advertising, with the poster Ruien gave us <33

### 12:00 AM - 7:00 AM

Pretty fun, we worked until about 3 AM, and when everybody went to sleep. I decided to stay up, chug 3 cups of boba, and honestly accomplish like nothing. I can hardly remember anything about this time. I think I was high. In fact, this all-nighter was so severe, I lost my taste for boba for (almost) an entire day 😱😱😱

| Don't pull all nighters! You're way more productive after a good night's sleep, and you'll be able to do a lot more work in the morning. |

### 7:00 AM - 12:00 PM

When everybody woke up, we did some work on the presentation/submitted our Devpost submission, and got ready for judging.

We also got to eat mochi waffles~

_please excuse my terrible plating_\*

I also took a 20-minute power nap, which made me feel even more tired DD:

## Closing Thoughts

Los Altos Hacks was one of the most fun experiences I've ever had, even though I was exhausted afterward. We got to meet a lot of amazing people, and it was great seeing all of the other projects people made. Huge shoutout the all of the
organizers, and Maggie for being the most ✨slay✨ teammate ever.
