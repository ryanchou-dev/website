## how im doing~

YO! Welcome back to my blog >W<

The past couple months have been nothing, but an thriller. With my new schedule at school, The people I've
met are nothing short of extraordinary, and my new teachers are exceedingly dull. (Luckily, there's
nothing that a fresh cup of boba can't fix. 🧋)

Truthfully, the majority of my teachers are ⭐, and I'm excited to work with them. (except my science teacher 🤭)

As we turn into the holidays, and competition season 😩, I can't be helped to be filled with joy >:D
This summer honestly disappointing, and I slept **WAY** too much, so now I'm in this ✨ultra grind✨ to try to prepare for USACO, math, and balance school work in process.

Ehh, that's all you'll hear from my life, but something more exciting is a

Pretty good bang for your buck. If you go on Tuesdays, you get a free uprgade to a larger cup, which is `32oz`.
However, the drink is really sugary and all the flavors taste the same.

I got a Mango Lychee MT.

## Milk Tea Lab

Pretty standard drink, but way too pricy. But, if I were to find one of these at an event, it would make my day.

I (think) got a MT & Passionfruit Tea

## Mochinut

Great drink and can, and drink was pretty flavorful considering that it was primarily a mochi donut place.

I got an Ube MT with brown sugar boba.

## Sheng Kee

Drink and boba is not that great, but for only 3$, it's a great deal. They also fill it with toppings <3

I got the Mango GT with boba and mango jelly.

Drink is much higher quality, and the boba is so soft~
My only complaint is that it's kinda pricy, but it's the only boba shop that's open in the morning, it's great for school.

I got the Tiger Boba Latte.

OMFG THIS PLACE IS INCREDIBLE...

The environment is on point, and the shop is just so pretty. They also serve ramen and other yummy food.
Great place to meet with friends 🤩

A little pricy, but you should at least try it once. It's the best boba I ever had~

I got the Mango Pomelo Sago (recommend 10/10)
